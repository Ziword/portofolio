          <p>
            MJGAPPS is an application that serves as a companion to the Oracle E
            Business Suite R12 ERP system. This application was developed as a
            direct request from management to customize features of the ERP
            system. It is built using ReactJS with NextJS framework and has an
            ExpressJS backend, with an Oracle DB database. The application uses
            JWT as a standard session and can be containerized using Docker.
            With this setup, the application can be easily deployed to different
            environments and be managed effectively through containerization.
            Additionally, the use of JWT provides a secure and efficient way to
            manage user sessions and authentication.
