          <h2>Realtime MJG GPS</h2>
          <p>
            MJG GPS is a real-time GPS tracking application designed to track
            moving assets equipped with GPS trackers. This application is built
            using ReactJS with the NextJS framework on the frontend, and
            ExpressJS on the backend. Socket technology is utilized for
            communication between the frontend and backend to ensure seamless
            tracking. As the asset moves, the icon/marker on the map in the
            application will also move in real-time. Additionally, detailed
            information on the moving asset such as speed, GPS send date,
            movement history, destination, and other related information is also
            provided. Some of the technical features of MJGAPPS include
            real-time GPS tracking, integration with GPS trackers, ReactJS-based
            frontend, Next.js framework for server-side rendering, and a backend
            built with ExpressJS. Additionally, MJGAPPS uses sockets for
            real-time communication between the frontend and backend.
